# BellyButtonBiodiversity

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard that will allow us to easily look at an overview of each sample of bellybutton bacteria cultures based on the individual ID of that sample. The dashboard needs to include the following:
1. Dropdown menu to select the ID
2. demographic information on the ID that was selected
3. A bar graph of the top 10 bacterial cultures found in the sample
4. A gauge graph of the frequency they washed their belly button
5. A bubble chart showing the bacteria found and the amount found in the sample.

This was then published to a website using github pages that allows anyone to access the dashboard and select the samples they would like to view at will. My completed site is here: https://ccastanette.github.io/BellyButtonBiodiversity/
